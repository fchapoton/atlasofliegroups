{ Calculates the degrees in which a rep of W appears harmonically }
{ I think that harm and invariants are useful functions to have, but
of course I'm sure that they can be improved enormously; then I would
suggest incorporating them in character_tables.at }
{ A flaw or dangerous bend is that these are the invariant degrees for
W acting on the adjoint group, because the argument is a
CharacterTable rather than a root datum:

invariants(GL(3,R).character_table) = [2,3]

(not [1,2,3]). I'm not sure whether there ought to be
invariants(RootDatum rd) which would add a 1 for each dimension of the
center.}
