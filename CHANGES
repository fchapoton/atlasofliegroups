Changes to the Atlas of Lie Groups Software

A detailed history of the early development is found in the file
workinglog. Newer changes are documented in the CVS repository.
This file contains a summary of major changes to the software.

Version 0.4
* New commands related to K: Ktypeform, Ktypemat, branch, KGB,
trivial, test, sub_KGB, mod_lattice
* Many new help files

Version 0.3.1
* Updated INSTALL file with new readline instructions for the mac
Version 0.3
* Classification of Cartan classes now uses canonical representatives
* Added 'kgborder' and 'blockorder' commands
* Added 'dualkgb', 'dualblock', and 'dualmap' commands
* Added experimental commands 'smallkgb', 'smallblock', and smalldual variants
* Significant speed-up of K\G/B and block constructions
* Added a block mode on top of real mode
* Computed block and K-L data is persistent until leaving block mode
* Several subtle bugs (only rarely affecting results) were removed, notably
  one causing wrong 'blocku' output in some unequal rank inner classes
* Several changes to output format, including:
  - inclusion of canonical representative in Cartan output
  - addition of Cartan class infomation to K\G/B and block output
  - double-valued Cayley transforms are always ordered increasingly
  - addition of inverse Cayley transforms to block output
  - distinction between cross and Cayley in involution-reduced expressions
  - K-L output now makes reference to the Bruhat order

Version 0.2.6.2
* Fixed bug in wcells command
Version 0.2.6.1
* Added make compilable to sources/interpreter
* Fixed Makefile in sources/interpreter so cwebx really isn't needed
Version 0.2.6
* More complete realex command line interpreter
* New method of tracking compile date
Version 0.2.5.1
* New README and INSTALL files
* fixed gcc 4.0.3 bug
* includes realex command line interpreter
* output of Weyl words now includes commas
Version 0.2.5:
* Modified makefile to produce an executable atlas.exe and make a
symlink to it, so the help system will work when called from any
directory
* Added and updated online documentation, including block, kgb,
checkbasept, blockd, blocku, wgraph, wcells
* Changed extrkl to primkl
* Modified output of kgb and primkl commands
* Fixed bug in printing of real forms for inner class u
* Corrected PRIMES_MAX for RANK_MAX=16 and enabled RANK_MAX=32 on a 32
bit machine
* Added doxygen comments
* Fixed bug in (unused) sources/memory
