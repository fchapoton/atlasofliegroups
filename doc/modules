Modules of atlas listed by dependency in a broad (and somewhat vague) sense.
In any case any dependency included in the header file should come before.
Also a module whose implementation depends on another should come later

Error
  error		general error classes
  kl_error	a specific class for KL errors, captures some information

Utilities.

  Level 0: totally independent of everything else in atlas

  constants	constants and tables needed e.g. for bit fiddling
  arithmetic	integer arithmetic (patches), gcd, lcm, modular; rationals
  comparison    a class template for comparison objects
  hashtable	a class template for hash tables
  free_abelian	a class template for free abelian groups on a given set
  polynomials	a class template for polynomials
  tags		a collection of empty types for signalling to constructors
  tally		a class template for handling huge statistics efficiently
  set		trivial declarations: |size_t| is our universe

  Level 1: basic data type constructions

  bits		counting, locating bits in a word
  bitset	integers as sets of bits (replacement for |std::bitset|)
  bitmap	vectors of integers as sets of bits
  matrix	vectors, matrices and their operations
  graph		poset and (what's that??) symmetric poset class
  size		a class for factored representation of large composite numbers

  Level 2: constructions that relate to or use basic data types

  permutations	permutations, and their actions on (bit)vectors and matrices
  partition	parition of an interval, orbits (uses bitmap, comparison)
  poset		posets, hasse diagrams (uses graph)
  matreduc	matrix echelon algorithms, Smith form

Structure

  bitvector	variable size vector over F_2: bitset with a size indication
  subquotient	subspaces of F_2^n and quotients of such subspaces
  lietype	classes for holding Lie-type specifications
  dynkin	dynkin diagrams, and recognizing the classification of types
  lattice	functions for base change, orthogonal sublattice, saturation
  weylsize	functions for computing size of Weyl group (could be in lietype)

  prerootdata	class with just simple root and simple coroot information
  rootdata	root systems, root data, subsystems; support for handling roots
  weyl		Weyl group class, action on weights using (pre)rootdatum

  gradings	a (bitset) type for storing gradings; orthogonal root sets
  tori		analysing lattice involutions, defining a real torus
  topology	connect components of real red. group (dual components group)

  cartanclass	involution data, fibers, and Cartan class objects
  complexredgp  data type encompassing all data stored for an inner class
  realredgp	data type augmenting an inner class with a real form
  tits		classes for Tits groups in various forms, and their elements
