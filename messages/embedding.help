The "embedding" command prints information whose purpose is to make explicit,
for a given infinitesimal character, the base points of the dual KGB fibers
for the subgroup defined by the coroots with integral value on the
infinitesimal character when embedded in the dual fibers for the full group.
What is shown for each involution (fiber) is the offset of the subgroup
basepoint from the full group basepoint.
