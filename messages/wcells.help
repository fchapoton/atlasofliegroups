The "wcells" command prints out the normalized cells of the W-graph of the
block. This means that the cells are output abstractly, renumbered from zero.
This is usually what one wants, for legibility and comparison purposes;
however, the partition of the elements of the block into cells is lost in
this way.

Each cell is introduced with a line of the form "// cell #xx."  What
follows is a list of elements in the cell, numbered 0 to n-1, one per
line. After the number of a cell element is its tau invariant,
enclosed in braces, a subset of {1,...,r} (with r the number of simple
roots). 

Following the tau invariant in row j is a collection of pairs (k,m).
The presence of a pair means that there is an oriented edge of the
W-graph joining the present element #j of the cell to element #k,
having multiplicity m.  (The multiplicity is a coefficient of highest
possible power of q in the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial indexed by j and
k.)

The presence of the edge from j to k means that two conditions are
satisfied: first, that tau(j) is not contained in tau(k); and second,
that the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial indexed by j and k has highest
possible degree.

The Weyl group representation attached to the cell may be described as
follows. It has a Z basis {L_j} indexed by the cell elements j. If
root i is in the tau invariant for element j, then

s_i(L_j) = -L_j.

If i is not in the tau invariant, then

s_i(L_j) = L_j + sum_{elements k, i in tau(k)} mL_k.

That is, L_k appears in the sum here if i is in the tau-invariant of
L_k, and the pair (j,m) appears in the list for row k.

For example, here is the output of wcells for the simply connected
group SU(2,1) and the block of the trivial representation:

// cell #0
0:{}:{}
// cell #1
0:{2}:{(1,1)}
1:{1}:{(0,1)}
// cell #2
0:{1}:{(1,1)}
1:{2}:{(0,1)}
// cell #3
0:{1,2}:{}

If we look at the Weyl group representation attached to cell #1, we
find

s_1(L_0) =  L_0 + L_1   s_2(L_0) = -L_0
s_1(L_1) = -L_0         s_2(L_1) =  L_1 + L_0.
