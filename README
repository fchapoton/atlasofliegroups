Instruction on downloading and installation of the Atlas software.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

UNIX (including linux, solaris, and Mac OSX)

SHORT VERSION (for experts):
  Edit the makefile; make; make install

LONGER VERSION:

1) Download the source code, which is a tgz (tarred and gzipped) file.

2) To unpack the archive give the command 

  tar xvfz atlas.tgz

to unpack the archive. (On Solaris you might need gtar). 

On some systems the file will automatically untar to give a file
atlas.tar, in which case give the command 

  tar xvf atlas.tar

3) Now cd to the 'atlas' directory that has been created.
If you prefer to install the software in a place other than the
current directory, edit the makefile and change the values of
the variables INSTALLDIR and BINDIR near the top of that file.

4) Cross your fingers and run the command

  make

If you get some errors about readline see below, or try:

  make readline=false

to compile without the readline. Some other options are:

  verbose=true 
  debug=true 
  optimize=true 
  profile=true 

5) If all goes well, run the command

  make install

This may require root privileges, depending on the locations
of INSTALLDIR and BINDIR.

6) The command atlas, or ./atlas, will run the program.

Compiling with readline on a Mac (contributed by David Vogan)

readline allows you to recall the previous command with control-p, and
other useful command line shortcuts.

Get readline-5.1.tar.gz, for example from

ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-5.1.tar.gz

Mac automatically unzips.  Put file readline-5.1.tar someplace
convenient.  In a terminal window, go to the directory with this tar
file, and type

  tar -xvf readline-5.1.tar

This will create a new subdirectory "readline-5.1."  Do a cd to that
directory, and type

  ./configure

Type 
  
  make everything

Type

  sudo make install

The Gnu readline library should now be installed on your Mac.

There is a problem when the atlas software is linked: the linker
will find most of the readline commands in someplace like

/usr/lib/libreadline.dylib,

instead of in the Gnu readline library that you just installed, which
lives at

/usr/local/lib/libreadline.5.1.dylib

The difficulty is that the Mac library lacks two or three of the
commands used in the atlas readline, so the linker will refuse to
finish.  I don't know the best or most natural way to fix this.  One
thing which works is to edit the atlas makefile, modifying the line

        rlincludes := -lreadline -lcurses

to read

        rlincludes := -lreadline.5.1 -lcurses

Now the atlas software should link; there will be some warnings that
the symbols UP, PC, and BC were multiply defined, but as far as I can
see they are harmless.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

WINDOWS

1) Download the distribution atlasWindows.zip to your windows
machine. 

2) Right click on the file to extract the archive.

3) Double click on the atlas file to execute.

When you extract the file you create a folder. This contains the
executable atlas.exe. It also contains three necessary dll files. You
must run the executable from a folder containing these files.
