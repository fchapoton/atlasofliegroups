* Mathematical work to be done

* Work on the Atlas library
 - Implement a new (Thicketless) version of the KL algorithm
 - Remove the clumsy Helper class from the KL construction
 - Redefine ordering on parameters in a SR_poly to sort on x first
 - Rewrite partial_block generation to use the same method as nblock
* Work on the atlas program
 - Clean up the messy Input class
   The getline method never uses the stream passed to it, except to return it
   and the same goes for commands::getInteractive. Ending a stream should lead
   to quitting the mode (at least) and eventually to terminating the program.
* Work on the realex program

 - Allow for declaring an input path, and (silent) default prelude
 - Make that adding the .rx extension is not tried if it is already present
 - Handle catching of a user interrupt
   When a user types ^C, this should break off computation as soon as feasible
   and return the realex prompt. This may be quite difficult to implement if
   for interrupts happening while an atlas library function is executing.

 - Mention file and line in non-syntax errors
 - Improve output of expressions
 - Make last computed value(s) accessible
 - Add functions for string decomposition (maybe some composition as well)
 - Add function for Lie type decomposition
 - Add more functionality for KGBElt values
 - Improve the way KL_block gives access to it values, add variants
   Inspect how KL_block is actually used, and provide more lightweight values

 - Allow recursion through a more intuitive syntax
 - Allow overloading by a dynamically computed function value
 - See if functions without argument can still live in overload table
   Currently they live in the table for ordinary variables, which can produce
   some subtle asymmetry in their handling (notably their treatment changes
   when a first overloaded instance is added). It would be preferable to treat
   them as overloaded functions anyway, but to disable the voiding coercion in
   argument positions of overloaded functions. Check possible complications.

 - Allow loops executed in reverse order
   This generalises downto to for-in loops. Saying 'for e@i reverse in array
   do f(e,i) od' runs through elements of 'array' backwards, 'i' decreasing
   correspondingly; any row value built by loop is still constructed forward,
   so 'i' does not refer to position in built-up row in this case.

 - Premature exits: break from loop, return from function
 - Scoping in while loops: declarations of condition remain valid in body?
   The same question arises in conditional: if the condition is the result of
   a complicated computation, could that computation define some local
   variables that remain accessible in addition to the boolean condition?

 - Allow skipping entries in value-producing loops; concatenating sub-rows.
   When generating a row from a loop, not every iteration need contribute, and
   nested loops might want to contribute to the same row, in a concatenated
   fashion.

 - Allow for array slices and maybe other row-transformations
 - Extend type system to deal with second-order types
 - Extend language with recursive types, as well as disjoint union types.
 - Allow encapsulation into user-defined types

 - Check if efficiency features actually work as intended
   For instance v[i]=k should usually avoid a copy of v being made. Also see
   if something can be done to avoid duplication in a +:= x (probably not, as
   one knows nothing about what + does). However, for v #:= x in a loop it
   should be possible to avoid a new allocation for v at every iteration.
  - Duplication avoiding in component assignment
  - For loops in void context never build up any value.
* Work on the realex scripts

* Work on documentation

* Work on makefiles, distribution and support programs
 - Figure out how to avoid 'unrecognised typedef at line 367 of atlas_types.h'
