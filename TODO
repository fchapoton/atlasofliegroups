* Mathematical work to be done
- Study what the unequal rank case is about, and how to do it

* Work on the Atlas library
- Incorporate the calculation of c-invariant forms into the library
- Rewrite block construction using methods inspired by synthetic operations
- Rewrite K type computations to use data type more compatible with Param

* Work on the atlas program

- correct bug with mysterious typeahead after bailing out with ? (done?)
- clean up the mess dealing with input (interface/input, io/interactive...)

* Work on the realex program

- Make conditionals return shared pointer to global true and false values

- Investigate if some tracing facilty (printing "let" values) is feasible

- Integrate a bigint library to store realex int (and rat?) values; while
  attending that, signal overflow in arithmetic operations / conversions


- Improve output of expressions

- Allow multiple overloaded functions defined in a single 'set' statement

- Make balancing a general concept, also applied within row displays.

- Allow global variables with function value to be called if overload fails
  Currently a global variable with function value cannot be called directly
  at all if there are also overloads for it (one needs to say something like
  'let f=f in f(x,y)' instead). It would be more natural to consider calling
  the global function anyway if overload fails; the main difficulty seems
  that this might cause confusing error messages for arguments that were
  intended for an overloaded instance instead, but somehow fail to match.
  Since this is rare, maybe instead just consider globals before overloading.

- For identifiers in function position of a call, only consider local
  bindings (which will hide overloads) if those have function type. This
  allows continuing to use function 'x' after 'let x=x(p) in ...'.

- Implement compound assignment directly
  While 'v #:= x' (with vec v, int x) is easy to write (and common in loop
  bodies), it is converted to 'v := v#x' which is not efficient: with 'v'
  still shared when 'v#x' is evaluated, there is no chance of (at least on
  some occasions) reusing the same memory. This could be possible if built-in
  compound assignment were handled as a single operation (even though no user
  defined function could do such a thing). This is most useful for
  concatenation, but operations such as vector addition could also profit.

- Implement value gathering in loop using a sl_list if size is not known.
  Currently all loops gather values in a std::vector; while loops (as well as
  future loops using features that make size of resulting row unknown when
  the loop is started) might do better gathering them in a list structure.

- Allow list-comprehension syntax like in Haskell (and Python?)

- Premature exits: break from loop, return from function
- Scoping in while loops: declarations of condition remain valid in body?
  The same question arises in conditional: if the condition is the result of
  a complicated computation, could that computation define some local
  variables that remain accessible in addition to the boolean condition?
  However for the conditional one could start a 'let' block before the
  conditional starts to keep variables in scope; for while this doesn't work.

- Allow skipping entries in value-producing loops; concatenating sub-rows.
  When generating a row from a loop, not every iteration need contribute, and
  nested loops might want to contribute to the same row, in a concatenated
  fashion.

- Extend type system to deal with second-order types
- Extend language with recursive types, as well as disjoint union types.
- Allow encapsulation into user-defined types

- Ensure that root data obtained from inner classes or beyond are shared
- Avoid creating many identical |real_form_value| instances, by storing links
  to those currently generated within an |inner_class_value| object
- Check whether nested voiding in loops is necessary, maybe do only outer one
- Check if efficiency features actually work as intended
  For instance v[i]=k should usually avoid a copy of v being made. Also see
  if something can be done to avoid duplication in a +:= x (probably not, as
  one knows nothing about what + does). However, for v #:= x in a loop it
  should be possible to avoid a new allocation for v at every iteration.
- Duplication avoiding in component assignment
- For loops in void context never build up any value.

* Work on the realex scripts
- Complete the groups in groups.rx (types G,F); also avoid use of "s" etc.

* Work on documentation

- Write a tutorial on the realex languge, in bottom-up style

* Work on makefiles, distribution and support programs (cwebx)
- Change interpreter/Makefile so it does not remake io/fliekl.cpp and friends
- Figure out how to avoid 'unrecognised typedef at line 367 of atlas_types.h'
- Make cweavex format a 2-line "do x; while(y);" with cirrect indentation
- Make cwebx messages mention file name, to 'make -jN' output comprehensible
- Add some make targets for recording options as suggested by Nelson Beebe
